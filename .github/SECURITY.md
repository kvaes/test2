## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### For Critical Security Issues

2. Send an email to the project maintainers with:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### For Non-Critical Security Issues

1. Create a private security advisory on GitHub
2. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
3. Provide reproduction steps
4. Suggest potential fixes if possible

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues will be addressed within 30 days, non-critical issues within 90 days
- **Disclosure**: Once fixed, we will coordinate responsible disclosure
